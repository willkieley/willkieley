# Work Examples
## Script I made in class from bringing my year long project from OLTP to OLAP using SQL.
### This script is an example of the project I did for a 3 sequence class that lasted a whole year. This script allows an individual to bring the relevant data from a very large datawarehouse to a smaller datamart to show to a client. The reason you want to show this to a client is because this is an example of a database that individuals can understand that do not have an analytics background.
